//! ## Glossary
//!
//! * *SPI Bus* - a shared bus consisting of three shared wires (Clock, COPI and
//!   CIPO) and a unique 'Chip Select' wire for each device on the bus. An *SPI
//!   Bus* typically only has one *SPI Controller* which is 'driving' the bus
//!   (specifically it is driving the clock signal and the *COPI* data line).
//! * *COPI* - One of the data lines on an *SPI Bus*. Stands for *Controller
//!   Out, Peripheral In*, but we use the term *SPI Device* instead of *SPI
//!   Peripheral*.
//! * *CIPO* - One of the data lines on an *SPI Bus*. Stands for *Controller In,
//!   Peripheral Out*, but we use the term *SPI Device* instead of *SPI
//!   Peripheral*.
//! * *SPI Controller* - a block of silicon within the RP2040 designed for
//!   driving an *SPI Bus*.
//! * *SPI Device* - a device on the *SPI Bus*; has its own unique chip select
//!   signal.
//! * *Device Driver* - a Rust type (and/or a value of that type) which
//!   represents a particular *SPI Device*, such as an Bosch BMA400
//!   accelerometer chip, or an ST7789 LCD controller chip.
