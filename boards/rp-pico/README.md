# [rp-pico] - Board Support for the [Raspberry Pi Pico]

You should include this crate if you are writing code that you want to run on
a [Raspberry Pi Pico] - the original launch PCB for the RP2040 chip.

This crate includes the [rp2040-hal], but also configures each pin of the
RP2040 chip according to how it is connected up on the Pico.

## Using

To use this crate, your `Cargo.toml` file should contain:

```toml
rp-pico = "0.3.0"
```

In your program, you will need to call `rp_pico::Pins::new` to create
a new `Pins` structure. This will set up all the GPIOs for any on-board
devices. See the [examples](./examples) folder for more details.

## Examples

### General Instructions

To compile an example, clone the _rp-hal_ repository and run:

```console
rp-hal/boards/rp-pico $ cargo build --release --example <name>
```

You will get an ELF file called
`./target/thumbv6m-none-eabi/release/examples/<name>`, where the `target`
folder is located at the top of the _rp-hal_ repository checkout. Normally
you would also need to specify `--target=thumbv6m-none-eabi` but when
building examples from this git repository, that is set as the default.

If you want to convert the ELF file to a UF2 and automatically copy it to the
USB drive exported by the RP2040 bootloader, simply boot your board into
bootloader mode and run:

```console
rp-hal/boards/rp-pico $ cargo run --release --example <name>
```

If you get an error about not being able to find `elf2uf2-rs`, try:

```console
$ cargo install elf2uf2-rs
```
then try repeating the `cargo run` command above.

### [pico_blinky](./examples/pico_blinky.rs)

Flashes the Pico's on-board LED on and off.

### [pico_gpio_in_out](./examples/pico_gpio_in_out.rs)

Reads a push button attached to GPIO 15 and drives the on-board LED to match it (i.e. on when pressed, off when not pressed).

### [pico_rtic](./examples/pico_rtic.rs)

Demonstrates the use of the [Real-Time Interrupt-driven Concurrency Framework] on the Raspberry Pi Pico.

[Real-Time Interrupt-driven Concurrency Framework]: https://rtic.rs

### [pico_countdown_blinky](./examples/pico_countdown_blinky.rs)

Another LED blinking example, but using a Timer in count-down mode.

### [pico_pwm_blink](./examples/pico_pwm_blink.rs)

Puts out an analog 'triangle wave' on GPIO 25, using the PWM hardware.

### [pico_usb_serial](./examples/pico_usb_serial.rs)

Creates a USB Serial device on a Pico board.

The USB Serial device will print `HelloWorld` on start-up, and then echo any
incoming characters - except that any lower-case ASCII characters are
converted to the upper-case equivalent.

### [pico_usb_serial_interrupt](./examples/pico_usb_serial_interrupt.rs)

Creates a USB Serial device on a Pico board, but demonstrating handling
interrupts when USB data arrives.

### [pico_usb_twitchy_mouse](./examples/pico_usb_twitchy_mouse.rs)

Demonstrates emulating a USB Human Input Device (HID) Mouse. The mouse
cursor will jiggle up and down.

### [pico_spi_sd_card](./examples/pico_spi_sd_card.rs)

Example that shows how to use the
[embedded_sdmmc crate](https://github.com/rust-embedded-community/embedded-sdmmc-rs)
with the Raspberry Pi Pico.
