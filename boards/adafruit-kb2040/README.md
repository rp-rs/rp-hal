# [adafruit-kb2040] - Board Support for the [Adafruit KB2040]

You should include this crate if you are writing code that you want to run on
a [Adafruit KB2040] - an Arduino Pro Micro-shaped board for keyboards.

This crate includes the [rp2040-hal], but also configures each pin of the
RP2040 chip according to how it is connected up on the KB2040.

## Using

To use this crate, your `Cargo.toml` file should contain:

```toml
adafruit-kb2040 = "0.2.0"
```

In your program, you will need to call `adafruit-kb2040::Pins::new` to create
a new `Pins` structure. This will set up all the GPIOs for any on-board
devices. See the [examples](./examples) folder for more details.

## Examples

### General Instructions

To compile an example, clone the _rp-hal_ repository and run:

```console
rp-hal/boards/adafruit-kb2040 $ cargo build --release --example <name>
```

You will get an ELF file called
`./target/thumbv6m-none-eabi/release/examples/<name>`, where the `target`
folder is located at the top of the _rp-hal_ repository checkout. Normally
you would also need to specify `--target=thumbv6m-none-eabi` but when
building examples from this git repository, that is set as the default.

If you want to convert the ELF file to a UF2 and automatically copy it to the
USB drive exported by the RP2040 bootloader, simply boot your board into
bootloader mode and run:

```console
rp-hal/boards/adafruit-kb2040$ cargo run --release --example <name>
```

If you get an error about not being able to find `elf2uf2-rs`, try:

```console
$ cargo install elf2uf2-rs, then repeating the `cargo run` command above.
```

### [Rainbow](./examples/adafruit_kb2040_rainbow.rs)

This example will display a colour-wheel rainbow effect on the on-board LED.
