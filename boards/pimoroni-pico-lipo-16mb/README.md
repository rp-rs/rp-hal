# [pimoroni-pico-lipo-16mb] - Board Support for the [Pimoroni Pico Lipo 16MB]

You should include this crate if you are writing code that you want to run on
a [Pimoroni Pico Lipo 16MB] - a board with USB-C, STEMMA QT/Qwiic connectors,
plus a Li-Po battery charging circuit.

This crate includes the [rp2040-hal], but also configures each pin of the
RP2040 chip according to how it is connected up on the Pico Lipo.

Note that if you use this crate the compiler will expect the full 16MB flash
space, and so it may not work if you only have the 4MB variant.

## Using

To use this crate, your `Cargo.toml` file should contain:

```toml
pimoroni-pico-lipo-16mb = "0.3.0"
```

In your program, you will need to call `pimoroni_pico_lipo_16mb::Pins::new` to create
a new `Pins` structure. This will set up all the GPIOs for any on-board
devices. See the [examples](./examples) folder for more details.

## Examples

### General Instructions

To compile an example, clone the _rp-hal_ repository and run:

```console
rp-hal/boards/pimoroni-pico-lipo-16mb $ cargo build --release --example <name>
```

You will get an ELF file called
`./target/thumbv6m-none-eabi/release/examples/<name>`, where the `target`
folder is located at the top of the _rp-hal_ repository checkout. Normally
you would also need to specify `--target=thumbv6m-none-eabi` but when
building examples from this git repository, that is set as the default.

If you want to convert the ELF file to a UF2 and automatically copy it to the
USB drive exported by the RP2040 bootloader, simply boot your board into
bootloader mode and run:

```console
rp-hal/boards/pimoroni-pico-lipo-16mb $ cargo run --release --example <name>
```

If you get an error about not being able to find `elf2uf2-rs`, try:

```console
$ cargo install elf2uf2-rs, then repeating the `cargo run` command above.
```

### [pimoroni_pico_lipo_16mb_blinky](./examples/pimoroni_pico_lipo_16mb_blinky.rs)

Flashes the Pico Lipo's on-board LED on and off.
