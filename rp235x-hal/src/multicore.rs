//! Multicore support
//!
//! This module handles setup of the 2nd cpu core on the rp235x, which we refer to as core1.
//! It provides functionality for setting up the stack, and starting core1.
//!
//! The entrypoint for core1 can be any function that never returns, including closures.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use rp235x_hal::{
//!     gpio::Pins,
//!     multicore::{Multicore, Stack},
//!     pac,
//!     sio::Sio,
//! };
//!
//! static mut CORE1_STACK: Stack<4096> = Stack::new();
//!
//! fn core1_task() {
//!     loop {}
//! }
//!
//! fn main() -> ! {
//!     let mut pac = hal::pac::Peripherals::take().unwrap();
//!     let mut sio = Sio::new(pac.SIO);
//!     // Other init code above this line
//!     let mut mc = Multicore::new(&mut pac.PSM, &mut pac.PPB, &mut sio.fifo);
//!     let cores = mc.cores();
//!     let core1 = &mut cores[1];
//!     let _test = core1.spawn(CORE1_STACK.take().unwrap(), core1_task);
//!     // The rest of your application below this line
//!     # loop {}
//! }
//!
//! ```
//!
