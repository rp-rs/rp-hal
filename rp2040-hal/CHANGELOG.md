# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `rp2040-e5` feature enabling the workaround for errata 5 on the USB device peripheral.
- Support for critical-section 1.0.0.
  Critical-section 0.2 is still supported (ie. a custom-impl is provided, compatible
  with the 1.0.0 implementation), to avoid a breaking change. It will be removed
  later.

### Changed

- Update embedded-hal alpha support to version 1.0.0-alpha.8
- Implement `From<&SomeClock> for Hertz` instead of `From<SomeClock> for Hertz`
  for the clocks in `rp2040_hal::clocks`.
- Use `rp2040-hal`'s entry function.

## [0.5.0] - 2022-06-13

### MSRV

The Minimum-Supported Rust Version (MSRV) for this release is 1.61

### Added

- RP2040 specific #[entry] macro that releases spinlocks - @jannic
- Start multiple state machines in sync with each other - @astraw
- Unsafe fn for freeing all spinlocks when you can't use the RP2040 entry macro (eg RTIC) - @9names
- Optional feature for enabling defmt formatting for i2c errors - @ithinuel
- Accessor for getting the offset of an installed PIO program - @fenax

### Changed

- Use thread send safe UART* marker when splitting, improves UART ergonmics - @marius-meissner
- Improve performance for hardware division instrinsics. Internal intrinsics cleanup - @Sizurka
- Provide a better alarm abstraction - @ithinuel
- Update Multicore::spawn to be able to take a closure without requiring alloc.
  Improve Multicore ergonomics and add example for how to use new API - @Liamolucko
- Allow PIO program to be 32 instructions long, was previously limited to 31 - @jannic
- Fix Typos - @mqy, @danbev
- Replace generic pio::Tx::write<T> with write_u8_replicated, write_u16_replicated, and update
  write to take a u32. The generic version was too easy to misuse. - @9names

### Removed

- I2c async driver. Use new one at https://github.com/ithinuel/rp2040-async-i2c/ - @ithinuel
- Unused fields from UartPeripheral and Reader - @jannic

## [0.4.0] - 2022-03-09

### Added

- ROM function caching
- ROM version lookup function
- Compiler intrinsics for ROM functions
- Compiler intrinsics for hardware divider
- Document bsp_pins! macro
- UART IRQ examples
- PIO side-set example
- Stopped PIO state machines can change their clock divider
- Added HAL IRQ example

### Changed

- Rewrite UART driver to own its pins
- Improve UART defaults
- Fix repeated-read in i2c embassy driver
- Fix bug in i2c peripheral state machine
- Fix race condition in alarm
- Fix safety bugs in hardware divider
- Enable watchdog reset trigger bits when watchdog enabled
- Update spinlocks to use new PAC API
- Use generics to improve spinlock implementation
- Update critical_section to use new spinlock implementation
- Update embedded-hal alpha support to version 1.0.0-alpha.7
- Avoid 64-bit division in clock calculations
- Update pio and pio-proc to 0.2.0
