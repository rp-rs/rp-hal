- Fix spelling error in UART error discarded field - @Sizurka
- Fix contents of UART error discarded field - @Sizurka

- pio: Move interrupt related (en|dis)abling/forcing methods to the statemachine - @ithinuel
- Mark Timer & Alarm* Send and Sync - @ithinuel
- The feature critical-section-impl is now enabled by default from the BSP crates - @jannic
- Simplify signature of Alarm::schedule, removing generic parameter - @ithinuel
- USB: Use the dedicated write_bitmask_* functions - @ithinuel

### Added

- Add rtic-monotonic support for timer & alarms (feature gated) - @ithinuel
- Add SPI is_busy function - @papyDoctor
- Add set_fifos/set_rx_watermark/set_tx_watermark - @papyDoctor
- Add a method to allow setting the PIO's clock divisor without floats - @ithinuel
- Use TimerInstant in Timer::GetCounter & add Alarm::schedule_at - @ithinuel

### Removed

- Removed support for critical-section 0.2 (was already deprecated) - @jannic

## [0.6.0] - 2022-08-26

### Added

- Documentation Example for the bsp_pin! macro - @ hmvp
- Timer: Documentation & doc examples for Timers - @9names
- Add suspend, resume and remote wakeup support. - @ithinuel & @jannic

- Support for critical-section 1.0.0.
  Critical-section 0.2 is still supported (ie. a custom-impl is provided, compatible
  with the 1.0.0 implementation), to avoid a breaking change. It will be removed
  later. - @jannic

- Implement `From<&SomeClock> for Hertz` instead of `From<SomeClock> for Hertz`
  for the clocks in `rp2040_hal::clocks`. - @jannic
- Fix i2c example using the wrong clock. - @jannic
- Fix duty cycle handing on disabled pwm channels. - @jannic
- GPIO IRQ example: add check for interrupt source - @9names
- Align USB synchronisation requirements with the manual & pico-sdk - @ithinuel
- Update dependencies on usb-device to 0.2.9 - @ithinuel
- Use wfi in otherwise empty infinite loops in examples. - @jannic
- Use generic bootloader in examples - @jannic & @ithinuel
- Use `rp2040-hal`'s entry function. - @ithinuel
- Migrate from `embedded-time` to `fugit` - @ithinuel

- Clarify usage of boot2 section - @a-gavin

### Removed

- Unnecessary cortex_m::interrupt::free in timer.rs - @jannic
- Unused embassy-traits deps - @9names

## [0.5.0] - 2022-06-13

### MSRV

The Minimum-Supported Rust Version (MSRV) for this release is 1.61

### Added

- RP2040 specific #[entry] macro that releases spinlocks - @jannic
- Start multiple state machines in sync with each other - @astraw
- Unsafe fn for freeing all spinlocks when you can't use the RP2040 entry macro (eg RTIC) - @9names
- Optional feature for enabling defmt formatting for i2c errors - @ithinuel
- Accessor for getting the offset of an installed PIO program - @fenax

### Changed

- Use thread send safe UART* marker when splitting, improves UART ergonmics - @marius-meissner
- Improve performance for hardware division instrinsics. Internal intrinsics cleanup - @Sizurka
