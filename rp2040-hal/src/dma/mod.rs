//! Direct memory acces (DMA).
//!
//! The DMA unit of the RP2040 seems very simplistic at first when compared to other MCUs. For
//! example, the individual DMA channels do not support chaining multiple buffers. However, within
//! certain limits, the DMA engine supports a wide range of transfer and buffer types, often by
//! combining multiple DMA channels:
//!
//! * Simple RX/TX transfers filling a single buffer or transferring data from one peripheral to
//!   another.
//! * RX/TX transfers that use multiple chained buffers: These transfers require two channels to
//!   be combined, where the first DMA channel configures the second DMA channel. An example for
//!   this transfer type can be found in the datasheet.
//! * Repeated transfers from/to a set of buffers: By allocating one channel per buffer and
//!   chaining the channels together, continuous transfers to a set of ring buffers can be
//!   achieved. Note, however, that the MCU manually needs to reconfigure the DMA units unless the
//!   buffer addresses and sizes are aligned, in which case the ring buffer functionality of the
//!   DMA engine can be used. Even then, however, at least two DMA channels are required as a
//!   channel cannot be chained to itself.
//!
//! This API tries to provide three types of buffers: Single buffers, double-buffered transfers
//! where the user can specify the next buffer while the previous is being transferred, and
//! automatic continous ring buffers consisting of two aligned buffers being read or written
//! alternatingly.
