//! # GPIO IRQ Example
//!
//! This application demonstrates use of GPIO Interrupts.
//! It is also intended as a general introduction to interrupts with RP2040.
//!
//! Each GPIO can be triggered on the input being high (LevelHigh), being low (LevelLow)
//! starting high and then going low (EdgeLow) or starting low and becoming high (EdgeHigh)
//!
//! In this example, we trigger on EdgeLow. Our input pin configured to be pulled to the high logic-level
//! via an internal pullup resistor. This resistor is quite weak, so you can bring the logic level back to low
//! via an external jumper wire or switch.
//! Whenever we see the edge transition, we will toggle the output on GPIO25 - this is the LED pin on a Pico.
//!
//! Note that this demo does not perform any [software debouncing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch#Contact_bounce).
//! You can fix that through hardware, or you could disable the button interrupt in the interrupt and re-enable it
//! some time later using one of the Alarms of the Timer peripheral - this is left as an exercise for the reader.
//!
//! It may need to be adapted to your particular board layout and/or pin assignment.
//!
//! See the `Cargo.toml` file for Copyright and license details.
