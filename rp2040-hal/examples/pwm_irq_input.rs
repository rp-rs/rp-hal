//! # PWM IRQ Input Example
//!
//! Read a 5V 50Hz PWM servo input signal from gpio pin 1 and turn the LED on when
//! the input signal is high ( > 1600 us duty pulse width ) and off when low ( < 1400 us ).
//!
//! This signal is commonly used with radio control model systems and small servos.
//!
//! It may need to be adapted to your particular board layout and/or pin assignment.
//!
